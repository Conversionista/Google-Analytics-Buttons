# Google-Analytics-UI-Improvements


Makes creating multiple segments in Google Analytics faster and easier, when for example creating a funnel:
- When Creating/Editing a segment, add "Page", "Desktop" or "Mobile" to condition with just one click. (instead of browsing dropdowns)
- When Copying a segment, adds name of original segment. (instead of re-typing name manually for each new segment)
